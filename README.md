# Influence-map-based-pathfinding-and-AI
My final year university project. This game makes use of influence maps to aid in the decision making of AI and also as a heuristic for an A* algorithm

This project was completed as a double module in my final year as a computer games development student and received a high first class grade.

The project implements influence maps in a number of different forms including threat maps and death maps.
The data from these influence maps are then used for different purposes. The threat map is used in conjunction with an A* pathfinding algorithm as a heuristic to allow
fighters in the game to navigate around the dangerous areas in the scene.
The full influence maps or death maps are used to aid the decision making of the AI depending on the scenario.

Further information about the project including the report written on it can be found on my portfolio website.
